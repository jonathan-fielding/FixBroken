#fixBroken.js

Sometimes we can't control whether an image will 404 or not and unfortunately it makes our site look a little bit rubbish when we get missing images. Thats where fixBroken.js comes in, it allows you to set a fallback image which will be loaded in the event that the original image fails to load.

#Usage

fixImages.init();
